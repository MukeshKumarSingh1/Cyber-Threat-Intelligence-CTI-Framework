# Cyber-Threat-Intelligence-CTI-Framework

This project conceptualizes, designs, and documents a structured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Framework to empower legal, technical, and security professionals with a robust, systematic approach to real-time threat intelligence.

This CTI Framework defines a robust, layered, and intelligence-led defense model, integrating best-of-breed methodologies—from initial intelligence sourcing to operational response and continuous refinement. Each component—from HUMINT to threat hunting—is purposefully designed to enhance resilience, support legal compliance, streamline technical workflows, and fortify organizational security operations.
