# Cyber-Threat-Intelligence-CTI-Framework

This project presents a streamlined, modular Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Framework. It outlines a real-time, intelligence-driven approach for detecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threats, with practical applications across legal, technical, and security domains.

**Key Features:**

  Intelligence Collection: Ingests data from OSINT, HUMINT, SIGINT, and dark web sources.

  Analytical Models: Uses MITRE ATT&CK, Kill Chain, Diamond Model, and Pyramid of Pain for structured threat analysis.

  Legal Alignment: Applies TLP classification, evidence handling, and compliance with privacy and sharing protocols.

  Technical Integration: Works with SIEM, EDR, TIPs, and SOAR platforms for automated detection and response.

  Security Operations: Supports threat hunting, red teaming, and continuous defense improvement using KPIs and feedback loops.

**Outcome:**

A practical, scalable framework that empowers organizations to build a threat-informed defense strategyâ€”legally compliant, technically sound, and operationally effective.
